                    Happy New Year! As is tradition, most people will be making resolutions for the new year, and I am no exception. Unlike most people, I have a day by day plan for how I will be achieving my goals.<br><br>
                    <u>My Goals for this year:</u><ol><br>
                        <li>Increase Deadlift from 395 lbs to 500 lbs</li>
                        <li>Decrease weight from 225 lbs to 190 lbs or less.</li>
                        <li>Decrease body fat from ~25% to ~15% or less.</li>
                        <li>Learn PHP.</li>
                        <li>Refresh JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Learn Python</li>
                        <li>Learn Ruby and Rails</li>
                        <li>Get a job as a Developer (Hopefully at Proper Media)</li>
                    </ol><BR><BR></p>
                        <p class="article-body">The thing about resolutions is usually that people don't set realistic goals, and dont have a realistic plan to achieve them. Looking over the above list, you can see that my fitness goals all have measurable metrics, concrete indicators of success and failure. The following goals do not. In order to achieve them, I needed structure. I mapped out the next 6 months on a spreadsheet, placing 5 workouts and 3 study sessions per week. As long as I stay on pace, I should have worked through all the material available to me from  <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> in the subjects of PHP, JS, Python and Ruby. Literally every single lesson they have. And I don't mean to imply that that would give me mastery of the material, just that I at least would have a beginners understanding of the material, which hopefully should be enough to land me a job.</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">I've also scheduled two dates to have the "Job Transition" conversation with my superiors, one in March and one in June. I like this company very much, and if possible would like to continue to work for them in a developer role, but if that isn't possible I cant let comfort stand in the way of progress. It's 2019 and we are impeaching facists, protecting trans kids, and <i>achieving our goals</i><br><br>Let's get it.

                <p class="article-sub"><i>What is your "why"?</i></p>
                <p class="article-date">9/21/2018</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">While I work, I tend to listen to podcasts. I&rsquo;ve always found the human voice very comforting and much less distracting than music. Maybe that makes me wierd? I dont know. I usually listen to <a href="http://www.knowledgefight.com">Knowledge fight</a>, a podcast about how incredibly stupid Alex Jones and his cadre of con men are on a daily basis, but recently I have run out of new episodes and have expanded my scope of listening. I came across the <a href="http://gettingaroundtoit.libsyn.com/">Getting Around To It</a> podcast on lybsyn, and I fired up an episode where the hosts discuss Napoleon Dynamite with a guest who had just seen it for the first time.</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">I won&rsquo;t give you a play by play of the entire podcast, you should go listen to it yourself, but there was one point that stuck out to me. In the movie, Uncle Rico is played as a former jock desperately trying to rediscover high school, which is contrasted heavily by Napoleon&rsquo;s abysmal high school experience happening right before our eyes. The hosts surmised that this was intentional, not to say that everyone has a good or bad experience in high school, but to say that romanticizing the past can lead to an underwhelming future. At this point, I took a little assessment of my own past, and came to a realization... I have never been happy.</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">Don&rsquo;t misunderstand, I have had moments of happiness. I do things that make me happy for a while, but I have never been happy with everything in my life. In middle school I was placed forward into high school math and subsequently bullied so heavily that my parents had me switch schools a few years later. The new school didn&rsquo;t fix much, as I was now an outsider to friend cliques that had been a decade in the making. I moved on to college and struggled to make friends there as well. Marching in the band made me happy, but it came with forced associations with individuals who took delight in the psychological torture of hazing, or worse. My studies suffered and I dropped out, now living at home feeling like a failure as all my peers went on to bigger and better things with their lives [not all of them actually did, but it was how my depression phrased it to me]. Few years of drinking myself stupid between awful bouts of sobriety as a sales drone later, and I met Amy.</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">Amy makes me happy. Spending time with her, talking to her, listening to her, making her laugh, all of it makes me happy. I couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better partner, and for a few years, that was enough. But after moving to a couple new cities that I swore would make me happier, and a couple new jobs that I swore would be better, they weren&rsquo;t. And I wasn&rsquo;t. I started to think I would never be happy, that maybe nobody anywhere was happy.</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">I suspect I am building this job search up the same way in my mind, that once I get into programming and software development I will finally be happy, and it likely isn&rsquo;t true. Which begs the question, will I ever be happy at all? Will getting married do it? Buying a house? Getting a dog? A new computer? A ferrari? Having a kid or 12?</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">What the fuck do I do?</p><br>

                <p class="article-sub"><i>My desert island full of code</i></p>
                <p class="article-date">Posted September 11th, 2018</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">For the past 9 months I have been on a journey through learning to code on zero dollars. For reasons I won&rsquo;t get into here, going back to school or a coding bootcamp is entirely out of my reach. Ive been confined to using the free and low cost resources available on the internet and sheer force of will to make my career change, and I&rsquo;m quite frustrated. It&rsquo;s starting to feel like I&rsquo;m stuck on a desert island with strange tides that return all my messages in bottles to me, unseen by the world I wish to (re)join. The entire situation feels designed to benefit people with advantages over me. Who the hell can afford $18k (plus living expenses, because you cant work) for a three month coding bootcamp? Daddy&rsquo;s money can. <br><br>But whining about it wont get me anywhere.<br> </p><br>
                <p class="article-body">Heres the current version of the plan.</p><br>
                <ol class="article-body">
                	<li>Get my Java skills certified by Oracle. $250</li>
                	<li>Learn Spring framework</li>
                	<li>Learn MySQL/Hibernate</li>
                	<li>Rebuild this website with these technologies</li>
                	<li>Build another site, possibly a forum or wiki</li>
                	<li>Deep dive into Android</li>
                	<li>Build simple mobile game</li>
                	<li>?????</li>
                	<li>Get Hired for a million bazillion dollars a year (PROFIT)</li>
                	<!-- <li></li> -->
                </ol><br>
                <p class="article-body">Doing all this while maintaining a relationship, working in sales, paying bills, exercising, staving off depression... It gets hard. Really hard. And all the while in the back of my brain there is a ticking clock that keeps tapping me on the shoulder and saying &quot;hey fuckface, don&rsquo;t forget youre almost fuckin thirty. Nobody is going to hire you when there are fresh CS majors coming out of college. Quit now. Fucking do it you god damn shit.&quot;</p><br>
                <p class="article-body">My current job is located less than 100 yards from the water in San Diego. I can sit here, right now and watch guys my age while away a tuesday afternoon surfing, jogging the boardwalk, generally doing not much at all. I can&rsquo;t get the thought out of my head that they know something I don&rsquo;t. The rent here is insanely high, usually around 2 grand for a studio. HOW can they possibly afford to spend even a couple of hours fucking around in the waves? It&rsquo;s beyond me. My life is stress, wall to wall. I need a raise and a break.<br><br>Fuck it, I&rsquo;m done.<br>		<i>--Erik</i></p><br>
